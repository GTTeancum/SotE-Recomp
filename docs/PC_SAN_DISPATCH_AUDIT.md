# Installed PC movie dispatch reference

This is a static executable audit, not a PC-game playthrough. The PC and N64
event numbers are not identical, so the N64 placements below follow matching
story scenes and runtime captures recorded in `SotE_TODO.MD`.

The PC code at `0x44F37B` dispatches on its event number minus three through
the byte table at `0x44F554` and jump table at `0x44F528`. Each named branch
passes its SAN filename to the movie player at `0x464460`.

| Movie | PC event | N64 runtime placement | Evidence in this project |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `L01INTRO.SAN` | 3 | 2 | Hoth boot film before title/selection. |
| `L02INTRO.SAN` | 4 | 4 | Escape opening before mission dialogue. |
| `L03INTRO.SAN` | 6 | 6 | Asteroid Field approach before briefing. |
| `L04INTRO.SAN` | 8 | 7 | Ord Mantell story before playable train event 8. |
| `L04BOSS.SAN` | 10 | 10 | IG-88 arena entry. |
| `L05INTRO.SAN` | 14 | 11 | Gall story before ship-side briefing/event 14. |
| `L06INTRO.SAN` | 17 | 16 | Mos Eisley Part III story before bike/event 17. |
| `L07INTRO.SAN` | 20 | 18 or 19 | Freighter story before interior/event 20; direct selection enters 19. |
| `L08INTRO.SAN` | 25 | 24 | Sewers story before objective/event 25. |
| `L10INTRO.SAN` | 29 | 28 | Skyhook story before turret/event 29. |

`L05BOSS.SAN` and `L09BOSS.SAN` are absent from that event table. Their only
filename references are the separate PC actor branches at `0x4550B2` and
`0x455C35`, respectively. The corresponding N64 Boba Fett and Gladiator Droid
command-10 branches now cue those movies in PC cutscene mode. Static branch
matching and synthetic runtime cues support the placement; reaching both
encounters through normal gameplay remains unverified.

The table does not prove movie sound, visual handoff, or native story skip.
Those are checked separately in the running N64 recompilation and listed in
`SotE_TODO.MD`.
